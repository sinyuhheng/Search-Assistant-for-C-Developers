# Search Assistant for C Developers
 An AI Expert System that helps users to generate web search query in C Programming domain

Programmers and developers spend most of their time searching the solutions or information of certain problem and errors encountered during programming. Recent search engines could only help the users to scope down their search to a general level. This study proposed a solution to enhance the search experience of a user, that will reduce the time and effort wasted on trying different queries to search the desired results. The system will help users to refine the query whenever necessary and pass it to the search engine. The returned search results will be evaluated and grouped before passing it to the user. Several Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning algorithms are utilized in this study to implement the solution.

The query analysis module specialized on analysis the user query and provide similar words and sentences. The metasearch module focused on performing metasearch. The website summarization module specialized on generating keyword based on the summary extracted from each of the search results. The website grouping and ranking module focused on grouping the search results based on the generated keywords, then rank the results based on the similarity of the user query and the generated keywords and summary. All these four components will be integrated to form the complete search assistant system.
